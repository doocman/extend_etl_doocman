# etl_variant_visit

This repo serves as an extension to the great ETL library, adding the extra feature of `etl::visit`,
as etl:s analogue version of `std::visit`.

This is still very much a work in progress and decisions about exception/no exception handling as well as
testing of platforms are needed before being regarded fully production ready (in which case etl itself may
already include this functionality.)

Nonetheless, please feel free to test it out and report potential bugs or platform problems back to me.
